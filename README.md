# MagnetHS
A new breed of homeserver for matrix.org. Using .NET Core 2.0.

## What is MagnetHS

MagnetHS is a fully decoupled set of microservices that will one day form a full implementation of a matrix.org homeserver.
The name comes together from the fact that the services are disconnected, yet can act as one coherent HS with minimal latency.

## Design

See [docs](https://github.com/Half-Shot/MagnetHS/tree/master/docs) for more information on how MagnetHS is/will be put together.
